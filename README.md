This code is basically about to create library system so i have provided a code on that which works on different classes methods it takes the input from the user where at first in code we get access to open as a librarian or member or else we can simply get exit to library. But if chosen the librarian then it again open some different option form 1 to 7 like adding a book enter member details where it asks name age and mobile number and many different ways are to to remove a book we also get access which person has borrowed how much copies of a particular or single book or after entering entering as a member it first asks about all your details book id and all an then again 6 options are opened and then there you will see all available books , return book issue book pay fine if your borrowed more than 10 days then there it will show you fine paying option also. and if you dont want all this or press any other option simply it will print the invalid option chosen and simply exit out of the library and print thanks for visting.
so my code works for all the run samples.
